    problem:
      "Smallholder farmers often lack access to timely, accurate information about soil conditions, leading to crop choices based on habit rather than data — and to avoidable losses in yield.",

      "I built a pipeline combining Decision Trees, SVMs, Random Forests, and Naive Bayes classifiers, benchmarked against each other to select the strongest performer for crop recommendation.
